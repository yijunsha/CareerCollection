		<p> I am Angelina Shao, an undergraduate junior at USC. Recently, I was at an event that reminded me of the endless career possibilities that are out there. However, I also realized that there are too many different options to experience them all with such limited time. So in place of this, I decided that I was going to create a blog and reach out to people in different fields to learn about their personal journeys to their current careers. From what I’ve learned so far, one person can change majors, jobs, and even careers many, many times in their lifetime.</p>

		<p>Thus, I want to invite you to share your story, in the form of a narrative (or any other creative form you would like to use, eg. script, diary, fantastical retelling, extended metaphor, etc.), of how you got to where you are today. I’ve attached a document with a small snippet of my personal experience to inspire initial thoughts but feel free to migrate from it if you’d like. When you’re done, please send it back to me at yijunsha@usc.edu. I would also be glad to come and personally interview you instead, if you would so rather (although, I would love to keep your personal tone in the piece so I hope you choose to send your story back!). I understand that you have a busy schedule but will appreciate any insight you can give me; even your small contributions will mean a lot.</p>

		<p>If you have spare time or would rather do something a bit more fun, I welcome you to take a video of a day in your life, as I would love to see your life through your eyes.</p>
